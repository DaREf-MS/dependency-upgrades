[1] Test runner (Count: 72): Tools for executing and managing automated JavaScript tests—running test suites, reporting results, handling test lifecycle (setup/teardown), and integrating with development and CI workflows.
[1] CSS processor (Count: 52): Tools and libraries that transform and post-process stylesheets using JavaScript plugins — parsing CSS, applying plugin-based transformations (nesting, variables, autoprefixing, minification), and generating optimized stylesheet output.
[1] Text processing (Count: 64): Utilities and libraries for manipulating and formatting plain text (e.g., word wrapping, line breaking, trimming, and wrapping text to specified column widths).
[1] Data format (Count: 54): Text-based data interchange and serialization formats for representing structured, human-readable and editable structured data (e.g., JSON and human-friendly extensions).
[1] Frontend (Count: 144): Libraries and frameworks for building user interfaces and client-side web applications — component frameworks, UI component libraries, and related frontend tooling (e.g., Vue component frameworks).
[1] Web framework (Count: 45): Server-side frameworks and libraries for building web applications and APIs, including routing, middleware (such as rate-limiting), and HTTP handling (e.g., Express).
[1] Documentation generator (Count: 29): Tools that generate API reference and developer documentation from source code, comments, and metadata—used to produce readable docs for libraries and applications (e.g., for JavaScript APIs).
[1] Release automation (Count: 30): Tools and utilities that automate software release workflows, including semantic versioning, changelog generation, tagging, and publishing workflows (e.g., using semver.org and conventionalcommits.org).
[1] Configuration management (Count: 27): Tools and libraries for loading and managing application configuration from environment variables and files (e.g., .env), enabling runtime configuration of applications.
[1] Mocking library (Count: 31): Provides test doubles (spies, stubs, and mocks) for creating, intercepting, and asserting behavior of functions or objects during JavaScript testing.
[1] Command Line Interface (Count: 54): Tools that provide command-line access to web platforms and services, enabling management of deployments, builds, site configuration, local development, and automation from the terminal.
[1] Geospatial (Count: 36): Covers mapping, geographic information systems (GIS), spatial datasets, and community resources and tools for working with open map data (e.g., OpenStreetMap).
[1] Polyfill (Count: 38): Libraries that implement or emulate missing browser or runtime APIs for older environments (e.g., providing AbortController and abortable fetch behavior when not natively available).
[1] Localization (Count: 26): Libraries and SDKs for internationalization and localization (i18n), including runtime string translation, language switching, and integration with translation platforms and translation management workflows.
[1] Module loader (Count: 41): Resolves and loads module/import dependencies at runtime or build time, handling module resolution, fetching, caching, and optional transformation or transpilation.
[1] API client library (Count: 63): Libraries or SDKs that provide programmatic access to remote services and cloud APIs (e.g., AWS SDK for JavaScript), usable in browser and server (Node.js) environments.
[1] File system utilities (Count: 35): Tools for interacting with the filesystem, including directory traversal and recursive file listing, path manipulation, reading/writing files, and file metadata operations.
[1] Testing utilities (Count: 46): Reusable helpers and utilities that assist in writing and running tests across frameworks—e.g., framework-agnostic test helpers for frontend applications—covering setup/teardown, DOM interactions, and common testing workflows.
[1] Static site generator (Count: 25): Tools that compile content and components (often using frontend frameworks like Vue) into static HTML/CSS/JS files for building deployable websites such as blogs, documentation, or marketing pages.
